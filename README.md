# Is Artifact a Dead Game?

tldr: yes.

### What
This website currently lists how many people are currently playing Artifact.

### Why
Petty spite. On the Artifact Steam Forums, shortly after the launch of Artifact, a heated topic of discussion was "is Artifact dying/going to die?". 

In my view, a lot of threads were being cluttered by folks saying things such as "It doesn't even have X players! It's doomed!!". This annoyed me, and so I built a website that would track the player count and (mockingly) points out the player count. 

The thought was that the game would, indeed, not die. This would make the website silly, a contradiction almost.

Instead it is I who is the fool for caring this hard.

### When
This was built in a weekend sometime before the actual death of Artifact. 

Someone wrote a silly article about it: https://www.thegamer.com/isartifactdead-dot-com-artifact/

### Who
I did this. I really liked Artifact and I was actually p. embarrased my epic own blew up in my face just as immediate as the game blew up in Valve's face.

### How
(this is for future me when I inevitably nuke the webserver its running on and I need a how-to, again)
1. clone it
2. install requirements.txt
3. serve it TODO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
